Several laboratory works where I worked on xv6 OS.

In first laboratory work (intro) I implemented pingpong and dump methods.

In second laboratory work I worked on optimising xv6 allocator.

In third laboratory work I implemented copy on write.

In fourth laboratory work I parsed Partable Executable format.
